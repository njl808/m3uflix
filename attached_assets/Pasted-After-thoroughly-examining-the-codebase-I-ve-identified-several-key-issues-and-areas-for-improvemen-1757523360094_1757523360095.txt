After thoroughly examining the codebase, I've identified several key issues and areas for improvement:

Current Architecture:

React frontend with TypeScript using Wouter for routing
Express.js backend with video streaming proxy
Xtream Codes API integration for IPTV content
Tailwind CSS for styling
Key Player Issues Identified:

Video Format Compatibility: The player tries to convert .ts to .m3u8 for live streams, but this may not work for all IPTV providers
Mixed Content Errors: HTTPS site trying to load HTTP streams causing security issues
Limited Video Format Support: Only supports basic HTML5 video element without HLS.js library
Error Handling: Generic error messages that don't help users understand specific issues
Stream URL Building: Hardcoded extensions and limited format flexibility
No Adaptive Streaming: Missing support for adaptive bitrate streaming
CORS Issues: While proxy exists, some edge cases may still cause problems
Plan:
1. Enhanced Video Player Component (client/src/pages/player.tsx)
Add HLS.js library support for proper HLS/M3U8 streaming
Implement multiple format fallback system (HLS → MP4 → TS)
Add better error handling with specific error codes and user-friendly messages
Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff
Add support for adaptive bitrate streaming
2. Improved Stream URL Building (client/src/lib/xtream-api.ts)
Add dynamic format detection based on stream type
Support multiple stream formats (m3u8, ts, mp4, mkv)
Implement fallback URL generation
Add stream quality selection
3. Enhanced Backend Proxy (server/routes.ts)
Add support for HLS manifest files (.m3u8)
Implement better error handling and logging
Add stream health checking
Support for different video codecs and containers
Add caching for frequently accessed streams
4. Security and Performance Improvements
Fix mixed content issues by ensuring HTTPS compatibility
Add stream validation and sanitization
Implement rate limiting for stream requests
Add connection pooling for better performance
5. User Experience Enhancements
Add loading states with progress indicators
Implement better error recovery options
Add stream quality selector in UI
Provide external player integration options (VLC, Kodi)
